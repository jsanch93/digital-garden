### Summary
<div class="summary">DigiKitty is an app designed to provide a fun and engaging Apple Watch game for people who love taking care of cats! I wanted the app to have a reminiscenct feel of the Tamagotchi games I played but adding a modern twist to it. The app allows users to take care of their virtual cat by feeding, playing, and getting it checked up. The more you take care of your cat, the more it will grow to love you.
