## Summary
Fowl Play: The Thanksgiving Escape Game is a unique puzzle game that combines physical and digital elements to create an engaging escape room experience. Players must solve a series of challenges to uncover the mystery of who threw away the turkey during a chaotic Thanksgiving dinner. The game features a humorous storyline, interactive puzzles, and character cards that enhance the narrative. I designed the "Gobble Feed," a digital social media feed that adds a modern twist to the traditional puzzle-solving experience. I also helped develop the Empathy Maps for the project.
