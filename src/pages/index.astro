		  Hey, I’m <span class="myName">Joey</span>. <br>
		  I’m a UX/UI designer and Front-End Developer. I want to develop and create products to help humans grow. I believe deeply in empathic and natural connections. People deserve to be able to carve their own space in this vast space we call the WORLD WIDE WEB. I would love to help create those connections. Let’s get emotional.
